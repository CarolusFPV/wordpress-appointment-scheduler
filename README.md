Wordpress plugin that adds a calendar shortcode where visitors can schedule a timeframe for themselves.
Great way to display who is doing something for each part of the day.

Length for each timeframe can be edited through the admin panel. (default is blocks of 60 min)
CSS for the shortcode gets injected automatically, this can be edited through the admin panel.
